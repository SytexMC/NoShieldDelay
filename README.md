# NoShieldDelay

Ever noticed how you raise your shield to block an attack, see the animation play, but still take damage? It's not lag or your imagination - Minecraft has a built-in 5-tick delay before shields actually become functional.

This plugin removes the server-side delay for shields, resulting in more responsive combat where your blocks register exactlyâ„¢ when you expect them to.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/SytexMC/NoShieldDelay/releases)
2. Place the `.jar` file in your server's `plugins` folder
3. Restart your server

2. Provide as much detail as possible about your server setup and the problem you're experiencing
